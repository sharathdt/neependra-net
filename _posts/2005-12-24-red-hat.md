So ,  
Finally I joined Red Hat last month.It was like dream come true.  
I do not have words to express my self.In a months time I learned a lot,  
got new mentor, new freinds.At Red Hat It feels great.Work is like fun here.

The very first day I joined , I felt at top of the world, a bit nervous.  
So, many things coming in my mind.  
Will I be able to do my work efficiently?  
Will I be able to make co-ordination with all the team members?

I saw the shadow man big picture ( Red Hat logo ) and got know how it got its name.  
My friends were so happy about me that I joined Red Hat. It really feels great when you  
hear from friends.
