On Wednesday(21 dec) we went for city tour.There I bought my MP3/Video/FM Tuner player for 280 singapore dollars.In buying my player I forget the time and me and Ritesh missed the bus and we were back to Hotel.In evening we just hang around here and there and in night we went for Night Safari.It was very late when we came back.Next Morning we went to Sentosa.It is an island and really the must visit place.We spent our whole day there.We saw underwater world,Cinemania(Virtual Reality) and had many more stuff.I took a bicycle for a ride and went here and there at the beach.I just took of my clothes and went in to the water.As I did not have any there spare clothes I have to wear that same underwear.It was a bad experience.Then we saw the Dolphin Show.It was fabulous and the way they do the stunts  
is amazing.Then we again roam around the beach and went back to hotel.

And the next day(23rd Dec) was our flight we were back to pune in same evening.So thats all!!!!!!!!!
