When we left college or when we are in college,we are not interested in what my other colleagues  
are doing and do not bother about them.But some how after one and half year we are interested in each other more.We wish good luck to same colleagues whom may be we hated or did not want to talk to them at that time in college.WHY?????

As we came out from our own Jabalpur we saw the world,the people and many tough situation.All the strange res around us.Our roommates,co-workers and the other place.They may become your good friend but you will not enjoy as much as with your college mates.We just had two parties (New Years and Abhishek&#8217;s B&#8217;day ) here in Pune and I observed a lot of changes in the behaviour of the same people of GRKIST.It&#8217;s fantastic.
