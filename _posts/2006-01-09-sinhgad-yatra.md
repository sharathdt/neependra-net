Yesterday I gave my XAT paper and then I went to Akshay&#8217;s Flat.Then Akshay,Abhishek Nema,Shekhar(Akshay&#8217;s cousin) and me started for Sinhgad Fort.It is some 35 km from pune.We started at 2:30 pm .We stopped at &#8220;Tinku da Dhaba&#8221; for our lunch.It was really bad and we left almost half of the food.Again we started off and after going some 20 km we stopped at Kadakwasla Dam.We took some snaps there and Akshay put forth one quote &#8220;Saloon Sharam karo bina ladki ke char log goomne aaye hain&#8221;; as there were love birds who were enjoying.

We started our journey again and went at the top.It was around 13-14 kms up from the bottom.That was really exiting and finally we reached there around 4:15 pm.We then parked our bikes and went to see the fort.The view from the top was nice.We went ahead but did not found so much of structure of fort.Akshay and me were stopped in-betwwen,but Abhishek and Shekar went ahead.We waited for them for almost half an hour and then we returned.The return journey was more exciting as there was slope as well as dark.We finally managed to come back by 8:15 pm.It was a lot of fun &#8230;&#8230;
