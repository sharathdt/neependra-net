In Red Hat we are suppose to do night shift for a week once in a six week.This is my first night shift week.The very first day i.e. on monday I did not slept at day time.I came to office early and stayed till night.it is really tuff to work in night.Our timing for the night is 10pm-7am.

I can&#8217;t sleep much at day time for first two days and felt very drousy at day time.My whole body toltally  
screwed up.I feel very different when you wake up in afternoon.Some times I tried to sleep in day time again but couldn&#8217;t successed.I did not have proper food in this week and whatever I had is in odd time.  
One thing I enjoyed is good food and other facilitis given by company.

But what to do!! Sab kuch karna padta hai.
