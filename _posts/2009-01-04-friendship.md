Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art&#8230; It has no survival value; rather is one of those things that gives value to survival. [C.S. Lewis](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/C.S._Lewis "C.S. Lewis"){.mw-redirect}

This first post of 2009 is to all my friends.  
Thanks for being with me.
