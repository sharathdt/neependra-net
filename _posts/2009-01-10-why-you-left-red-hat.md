Last month I left [Red Hat](http://redhat.com/) and joined a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">startup</span> [<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">KQInfotech</span>](http://kqinfotech.com/). Some of my friends, relatives and few unknowns ask me why I left Red Hat in such scenario when the market is down. Here are some thoughts which I had while making this <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">decision</span>:-

  * If not this time then never.
  * I always to wanted to work at system&#8217;s area, specially with Linux kernel. I might have got this opportunity at Red Hat after 2-3 years but that would have been bit late. At <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">KQInfotech</span> I was getting immediate opportunity.
  * I was getting into my comfort zone at Red Hat.
  * At <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">KQIfotech</span> I am also getting an opportunity to teach, which I always like. We are having a year long program [<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">PGDSP</span>](http://kqinfotech.com/pgdsp.html) in <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Gurukul</span> tradition, in which we will be taking 20 interns and they will be trained to become a system programmer.There is no fee for this course.
  * To get a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">startup</span> experience. In future this will be helpful ðŸ™‚
  * Moving from support to development.
  * This was the right time to take risk as I am still single.
