On 1st Jan&#8217;09 I decided that I&#8217;ll learn Guitar his year. After inquiring for several times I finally went yesterday(31st) to join the class.Its been a month late but atleast I joined in the Jan month only.

After getting my pick I went to class where Mayur (Guitar Teacher) gave me first lesson.I played it for some time. Then I realised that it is not as easy as it seems. Putting the fourth finger at the correct place was the first task.I was able to do few times before leaving.

I hope to keep my interst alive for learing guitar.
