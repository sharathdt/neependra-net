By looking at the meeting minutes of the last [PLUG meet](http://www.plug.org.in/pipermail/plug-mail/2009-February/005618.html) I came across a video game called &#8220;<span><span>Frets on Fire</span></span>&#8220;. [_**Frets on Fire**_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frets_on_Fire) is a free, open-source Finnish music video game created by [Unreal Voodoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Voodoo "Unreal Voodoo") in which players use the keyboard to play along with on-screen musical notes to complete a song.

I liked the game and ended up playing this game rest of the weekend. My highest score in Easy mode was 16436. IMHO, this game will be helpful for all those who wants to learn Guitar. This game is available on Windows, Linux and Mac.
