So, its been some time since my profile had changed .. from support to development. its has been very happening till now. Leaning new things.. debugging things more closely. Few things I learnt, which I will now follow forever:-

  1. Coding style.
  2. Think for sufficient time before you code.
  3. Take a paper and pen and follow your code with sample values.
  4. Use the editor effectively.
  5. Free the allocated memory.

I am putting down above things after 4 years of experience. Isn&#8217;t this bad?  
Yes. it is.

I didn&#8217;t take care of above things when I was into support. But that would be an excuse. All of them are building blocks and these should be clear when you code in college &#8230;. but for that you have to code&#8230;

In my college days we preferred to copy the code rather writing it from scratch . This is only possible when your faculty is not good enough. Thanks to them, for providing me the content of this blog entry.
