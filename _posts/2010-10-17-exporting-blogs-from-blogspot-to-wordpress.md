While exporting my blogs from blogspot using the **_Tools->import_** of WordPress. I was getting &#8220;HTTP/1.0 403 Invalid AuthSub token&#8221; error.
  
So, I used [blogger2wordpress](http://blogger2wordpress.appspot.com/) tool to convert my older blogs to wordpress format and import it as wordpress blogs.
