On 26th Nov&#8217;10 I got myself a new bike, _**Royal Enfield Thunderbird.**_. My Pulsar served me loayally for [<img class="size-medium wp-image-133 alignright" title="My Thunderbird" src="../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_2880-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" />](../wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_2880.jpg)
  
around 6 years. I drove it over 50K Kms.Lots of memories attached with my old bike.
  
Its been some time since I booked it.I was keep postponing because of one reason or other.

The bike is bit expensive than others and everyone keeps suggesting me
  
that I should buy a Car. I was eyeing for this for such a long time and I can&#8217;t get it go just like that. One need to have a ride on this before
  
suggesting. I am planning to go for some long ride in near future.
