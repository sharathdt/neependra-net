I sat down to write down the blog post on my 31st December&#8217;s Bike ride and while writing I retrospected the whole year and thought to
  
pen it down. Last year was more important at personal front. I completed one year of my marriage with Kanika. I think first year of marriage would be very important in anyone&#8217;e life. You slowly realize that you not single anymore &#8230; :). Ours was arrange marriage and took some time understand each other. I thank my wife for that. She was working with DLF in Gurgaon [<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-227" title="On the day of our anniversary" src="http://neependra.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2871-300x225.jpg" alt="Kanika and Me" width="300" height="225" />](http://neependra.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2871.jpg)but post marriage she left it came to Pune.
  
After Six months of our marriage she took admission in <a href="http://acts.cdac.in/" target="_blank">C-DAC ACTS</a>, Pune for VLSI and Embedded course (DIVESD) and doing well. After joining the course our life has become a bit busy but that&#8217;s fine. Its going to get over next month.
  
On technical front this was also a good year. Our company is going ZFS Port to Linux and will doing GA in Mid January this year and I am very happy to be part of it. Last year I also gave Linux Kernel Internals trainings at Symantec, which was great learning experience. I also gave two presentations at two FOSS events, one <a href="http://www.neependra.net/kernel/I%20wrote%20a%20%E2%80%9DHello%20World%E2%80%9D%20Kernel%20module.%20What%20Next%3f%3f%3f.pdf" target="_blank">at Gnunify</a> and other <a href="http://neependra.net/?p=148" target="_blank">at Foss.in</a>. Apart from this couple of my articles on <a href="http://neependra.net/kernel/Systemtap-I.pdf" target="_blank">SystemTap</a> came in Linux For You.
  
I bought a [domain nam](http://neependra.net)e for my blogs, on which this post is hosted. I also got a Kindle(Amazons e-book reader) and a <a href="http://neependra.net/?p=132" target="_blank">new bike</a> for me.
  
I was hoping to get the possession of my flat last year but didn&#8217;t get it. I had to file case with Consumer Forum against the builder.
  
The case is still going but from the progress at site it looks I&#8217;ll get it soon. The possession is now delayed for nearly two years.
  
It has hit my pocket very badly. Lets hope for the best.
  
I also joined a guitar class which I have to leave in-between. I&#8217;ll give one more try and hope to continue practice this year.
  
I was not able attend Ishendra, Harita and Anurag&#8217;s wedding last year, which I didn&#8217;t want to miss.Â  Friends always have special place in my life and I feel bad to not be a part of their special moments.
  
Overall the 2010 was good. Leant few more lesson&#8217;s of life and will always cherish the memories&#8230;.
