<div id="_mcePaste">
  It all started in the January&#8217;11 <a href="http://www.plug.org.in/">PLUG </a>meet. We were discussing about different tracks in<a href="http://gnunify.in/"> Gnunify&#8217;11</a>.As <a href="Gnunify">Gnunify</a> is mostly student oriented, I put forwarded the idea to have Programming Contest this year.

    The main idea was to let students learn something new and to force them we decided to declare the topics of the contest earlier.So, after looking at the topics they go back and study it. Here is the list of topics we chose:-
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <div>
      * Process
    </div>
    
    <div>
      * Process Control
    </div>
    
    <div>
      * File I/O
    </div>
    
    <div>
      * Signals
    </div>
    
    <div>
      * Locking Primitives(Mutex/Semaphores)
    </div>
    
    <div>
      * Multi Threading
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  Initially we thought to add rpm/deb packaging as well but later we dropped that idea.

    More than 140 students registered for the contest. Out of which 104 turned up for the stage I (written test), which was conducted on 11th Feb&#8217;11.We chose 13 students from them for stage II(lab test).

[Kiran Divekar](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3685052) was our judge for the contest. He talked to each one of  the second stage participants and looked at their code. We had three winners, one for the the 1st place and two for the 2nd place. Prize money worth INR 5000 was distributed among them . We had a small prize distribution ceremony as well.

I would like to thank all the [PLUG](http://www.plug.org.in/) member who believed in the idea and all the volunteers for managing it. Overall we saw great response for the programming contest. I hope we&#8217;ll have it in Gnunify&#8217;12 as well.  It was great fun!!!
