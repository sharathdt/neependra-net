  <a href="http://www.aksharbharati.org/">Akshar Bharati </a>is really encouraging the habit of reading in children between age group 5-15 years from underprivileged and remote areas. Can the similar be done for the poor students who stay near to our office/society etc? Also can we have a library for us or our children?
