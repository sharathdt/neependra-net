Last month I finished teaching a semester course on Operation Systems at [Â SICSR, Pune.](http://sicsr.ac.in/) We Started the session inÂ Mid June and finished on 1st September. In June and July I taught with my full time job atÂ STEC. I left STEC on 3rd August and then teaching became my primary focus.
  
I taught MSc(CA) first semester course. The students had varied back-ground.Â When myself and SICSR team, specially Harshad Gune were putting down Â objective of the course, we decided to teach by giving examples rather than typical OS theory. So that students at-least get to see the tools like cscope, git, make etc, through which they can traverse the kernel coded, Â compile the kernel&#8230; it they wanted ðŸ™‚
  
After the first session I was not sure whether student would be able to cope with the content which we have lined upÂ for them. Many times I just had to repeat the 75% of content of the previous lecture to make everyoneÂ on the same page. This was still OK but when students did not answer which I just taught I got reallyÂ frustrated. Â It felt like why I am trying to teach such advance stuff to the students who do not care.Â But there were some students who followed me as expected. I think this story of almost every class&#8230; :).
  
After couple of weeks of teaching I realized that may be I should not force students to learn each and everything I teach them. So I started focusing much on the fundamentals rather giving more details. This lowered my expectation from the class but at the same time students started grasping more.

That being said I saw good improvement in theirÂ understandingÂ of the subject over these months.Â I amÂ satisfiedÂ with kind of the results students showed me in my internal exams.

Earlier I took week-long courses but this was my first full semester course. The latter was much more challenging and fun. It was great learning learning experience for me.
  
I hope to get more opportunities to teach in future.
