Last  Saturday on 14th September&#8217;13 I gave on GlusterFS presentation at [LSPE-IN](http://www.meetup.com/lspe-in/events/108091572/). The title for the presentation was **Performance Characterization in Large distributed file system with GlusterFS .** Few days before the talk I looked at the attendee list to get  the feel of the audience. I felt  that not many of them have used GlusterFS by now. So I decided rather than covering lots of performance part I should cover the concepts of GlusterFS and talk about the performance challenges which can be there by design like file-system in user-space etc.
  
I am glad I did that as there were only 4 folks from ~70 attendees who have used GlusterFS before.

By going through the concepts the audience were able to compare GlusterFS with other solutions in the market. They asked interesting question about hashing algorithm, replication etc.

I attended the meetup till lunch. Other than giving the presentation I attended a keynote on **Challenges in scaling cloud storage**  by [Srivibhavan (Vibhav) Balaram](http://www.linkedin.com/in/srivibhavan) in which he talked about the challenges in cloud storage and  QoS in cloud environment. I also attended &#8220;**Scaling using event driven programming with Perl, A tutorial&#8221; [ ](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/aveek-misra/5/110/364)**[Aveek Mishra](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/aveek-misra/5/110/364).
  
This was again a very informative and well managed event. I&#8217;ll look forward to attend and present in future meet-ups.
