One more week is gone and this week as part of assignment for [Understanding Media by Understanding Google](https://www.coursera.org/course/googlemedia) we need to explicitly rank YouTube’s impact in these three areas – politics, culture, news and then explain our choice for the area we believe to have been most affected. Here is my take on that:-
  
I live in **India** and as per my opinion YouTube&#8217;s impact us (in India) in following areas in descending order:-

  1. Culture
  2. News and Politics

**Culture **is a very broad term. It can be considered as group of people or society bound by  :-
  
&#8211; ideas
  
&#8211; customs
  
&#8211; social behavior
  
&#8211; education
  
&#8211; arts
  
Now if in every second, more than [one hour of video is uploaded on YouTube](http://www.onehourpersecond.com/)  and with over [6 billion hours of videos](http://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html) watched each month , a niche culture is getting created every part of the World. Again this aligns with Google&#8217;s goal to serve the long tail. India is no exception here. If we look at the YouTube [channels for India](http://www.youtube.com/channels?gl=IN&hl=en-GB) then we&#8217;ll see following :-
  
&#8211; Best of YouTube
  
&#8211; Featured
  
&#8211; Music
  
&#8211; Comedy
  
&#8211; Films and Entertainment
  
&#8211; Gaming
  
&#8211; Beauty and Fashion
  
&#8211; From TV
  
&#8211; Sports
  
&#8211; Automobile
  
&#8211; How-to and DIY
  
&#8211; Tech
  
&#8211; Science and Education
  
&#8211; Cooking and Health
  
&#8211; Causes and Non-Profit
  
&#8211; News and Politics
  
&#8211; Lifestyle
  
Inside each of these categories there are many sub-channels. From the definition of culture we can consider each of these categories as a type of culture. I am sure each one of us would be part of one or more types. I personally visit YouTube for Music, Tech, Science and Education and News often. As far as I know most of friends and family members visit channels from one or more categories.
  
From the above I can say that YouTube&#8217;s imapct on culture in the most.
  
Also from the above list  **News and Politics **is a sub-category and can keep them in same bucket. If we look at the trend dashboard for India :-

we do not see many people are interested in following News and Politics on YouTube.
