In May&#8217;14 we had two docker meetups in Bangalore. First was on May 10th and [Shippable](https://www.shippable.com/) and second on May 31st at [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com) office. In [first meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/175590662/)Â we had two sessions

  * <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);">Â Issues faced while deploying Docker in production by Ragesh (<a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" style="color: #8899a6;" href="https://twitter.com/rageshk"><span style="color: #8899a6;">@</span><span class="u-linkComplex-target" style="color: #8899a6;">rageshk</span></a>Â ) from ShippableÂ </span>
  * Dry run of [my Dokcer workshop](http://neependra.net/docker/rootconfWorkshop.html) [@rootconf](https://rootconf.in/2014/)

Though there were less attendees in that meetup, we had good interaction.
  
Later in that week [Rohit](https://plus.google.com/+RohitJnagal/) pinged us and suggested to talk on &#8220;Resource isolation in Docker &#8221; as he is visiting India. We did not want to miss the chance to hear from him so organized the [second meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/183969082/) of May.Later he agreed to talk on &#8220;Docker Internals&#8221;. I thought it would be good idea to have some introductory on Go language, so reached out [#golang Bangalore G+ communityÂ ](https://plus.google.com/communities/102083447604771785504)Â to find out a speaker. [Shivakumar GNÂ ](https://plus.google.com/116188783840908192901/posts)agreed to take that up. Also [RoshanÂ ](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/roshan-nagekar/13/616/751)volunteered to talk on Chef and Docker. With that we had following agenda :-
  
1. [Introduction to Go Lang](http://talks.golang.org/2012/goforc.slide) &#8211;Â <a style="color: #3987cb;" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116188783840908192901">Shivakumar GN</a>
  
2. [Docker Internals](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1juVgXiLTM-ZmAmYBOshNwhBABkUqwIxVodHZwq-0eGg/edit#slide=id.p) &#8211;Â <a style="color: #3987cb;" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/106086309847039327812">Rohit Jnagal</a>Â , Google

We also tried to live stream and record the video. Though quality was not that great but a good start ðŸ™‚ .
  

  
We plan to do more hands on with #docker and #golang in future meetups.
