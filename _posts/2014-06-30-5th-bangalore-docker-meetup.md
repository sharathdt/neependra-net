Last weekend, 28th June we ha[d 5th Bangalore Docker meetup at Shippabale.](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/187898402/) Over the last few weeks we worked on the agenda and finalized on following :-

  Dockercon is scheduled on 9th-10th June&#8217;14.  If anyone of us attending Dockercon then he/she can share his/her experience. Else we&#8217;ll try to look at the Dockercon videos, blogs etc and attempt to summarize it.

  This time we were not able to do &#8220;Hands-on with DockerFiles&#8221; , so it would be scheduled for next meetup.
</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.670588);">
  ~20-25 people attended the meetup. Some of the participants came from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai">Chennai</a> to attend the this meetup.  ~40% of them were new to Docker, so along with my session I gave an overview of Docker as well. In my session I mostly summarized <a href="http://www.dockercon.com/">Dockercon</a> keynotes .
</p>

After my session Himanshu gave a demo of [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor), Though we were not able to see per container stats but overall stats were nicely shown on the browser. I think this is very useful tool and would use it regularly.

During my session I also share the coupon code which @vcoisne gave me, through which one setup few private repositories in [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) for free.
  
There have been lots of questions during the session so it very interactive.  Chennai guys seems interested in starting a Docker meetup group in Chennai and I heard that a Docker meetup group in coming in [Mysore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore) as well. We also decided to have short (15 &#8211; 20 mins) Docker Intro talk in few upcoming meetups, which would help new folks to understand other talks in the meetup.
  
We tried to live-stream the meetup but due to some issue there was no audio. Anyways next time we&#8217;ll to do better in that front.
