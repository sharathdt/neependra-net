I am happy to announce that my book on Docker, Docker Cookbook (<a href="http://dockercookbook.github.io/" target="_blank">dockercookbook.github.io</a>) got published last week.  I got introduced to the publisher through a tech friend of mine and I am thankful to him for sharing this opportunity with me. I started working on the book almost a year back.

I was very new to Docker at that time but was co-organizing <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore" target="_blank">Docker meetup</a> in Bangalore, India and learning from Docker community. The book covers concepts, managing Docker and images, Network and Data management for containers, Docker use-cases, Orchestration and Hosting platforms, Docker Performance and Security. I tried to put whatever I learned in last year or so. There are many more topics in wish-list. Hopefully I get the chance to cover them in second edition.. :).
  
I would like thank all the reviewers of the book, <a href="https://twitter.com/collier_s" target="_blank">Scott Collier</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AllanEspinosa/" target="_blank">Allan Espinosa</a>, [Julien Duponchelle](https://twitter.com/jduponchelle) and <a href="https://vishnugopal.com/" target="_blank">Vishnu Gopal</a>  for giving their valuable time to review the content, giving suggestions and finding my mistakes.
  
It had been more work than expected. I spent many weekends, nights to work on it. There were few times when it felt that I won&#8217;t be able to pull it off but thankfully I did. I want to thank my family, friends and co-workers at office who supported me with this project. It was great fun to work on the book. During the process I learnt a lot and Docker community had been great help.
  
I hope the readers would find the useful and learn from it. I have setup a <a href="https://tinyletter.com/dockercookbook" target="_blank">mailing list </a>through I would share updates, earrta bout the book. More details about the book can be found <a href="http://dockercookbook.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  
Lastly I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/arocks" target="_blank">Arun Ravindran </a>for allowing me <a href="http://djangopatternsbook.github.io/" target="_blank">re-using his book&#8217;s website</a> template for my <a href="http://dockercookbook.github.io/" target="_blank">Docker Book. </a>
