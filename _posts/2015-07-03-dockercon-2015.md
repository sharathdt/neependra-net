I got the opportunity to attend [DockerCon](http://www.dockercon.com/) last month  (June 22nn and 23rd&#8217;15) in San Francisco. This was my visit to SF. I reached there on 20th June&#8217;15. On 21st I took a bicycle on rent and cycled through [Golden Gate Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge), [Sausalito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausalito,_California) and [Tiburon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California). While coming back to SF I took Ferry from Tiburon. Later in the day I met [Suman](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/suman-chakravartula/19/708/587) in person, Founder of [RockStor Inc,](http://rockstor.com/)  whom I interacted few times virtually.
  
Next day on 22nd June, DockerCon started and one could feel lots on energy at the conference. Few important takeaways for me from the conferences are :-

  * Docker wants to make internet programmable and it is becoming a tool for mass innovation
  * Formation of [Open Container project](https://www.opencontainers.org/),  under the auspices of the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/), for creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime.
  * [runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc), which is implementation of Open Container Project specifications
  * Fast paced, bleeding edge Docker releases to experiment with upcoming features &#8211; [Docker experimental](http://(http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/experimental-binary/)) 
  * Built-in [multihost networking](http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/networking-receives-an-upgrade/) coming in next release, which would have plug-gable back-ends
  * Docker plugins to extend th[e capabilities of Docker Engine.](http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/extending-docker-with-plugins/) With Docker experimental release we can try Network and Volumes plugins today.
  * Announcement of [Docker Notary](https://github.com/docker/notary) to securely publish and verify content. It is still work in progress.

Docker 1.7 was released with announcement of [Docker Compose 1.3, Swarm 0.3 and Machine 0.3](http://blog.docker.com/2015/06/compose-1-3-swarm-0-3-machine-0-3/). Swarm now has Mesos integration and Machine can provistion different OS like RHEL, Fedora, Dabien, RancherOS

Other than talks I tried to catch-up with all the booths setup by different vendors/partners.  I also spent some time Red Hat booth and distributed [Container Coloring book by Dan Walsh.](https://github.com/rhatdan/coloringbook-containers)
