We organized Docker Global Hack Day at Red Hat Office on 19th Sep&#8217;15. Though there were lots RSVPs, the turn up for the event was less than expected. We started the day by showing the recording of [kick-off event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WACZzbKFRE).

The four ideas on which teams worked on are:-

  * [DockerBox](https://github.com/docker/global-hack-day-3/tree/master/DockerBox_Bangalore) &#8211; Alan Joseph ([@alanjoxa](https://github.com/docker/global-hack-day-3/blob/master/DockerBox_Bangalore/github.com/alanjoxa)), Fayiz Musthafa ([@fayizk1](https://github.com/docker/global-hack-day-3/blob/master/DockerBox_Bangalore/github.com/fayizk1))

Alan and Fayiz worked on PaaS idea, which can be used for setting up dev and qa environment.

  * [dockercomp](https://github.com/arcolife/dockerComp) &#8211; Archit Sharma ([@arcolife](http://www.twitter.com/arcolife)) &#8211; Local Hackathon Winner.

Archit was winner of [Docker Global Hack Day #2](http://neependra.net/?p=1249) as well for the same project. He updated the same project in this [hackathon](https://arcolife.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/docker-global-hack-day-mania-dockercomp/). His project is about crowd source analysis by using distributed computing  through  Docker.

  * Visualizing Docker Networking &#8211; Himanshu Roy

Himanshu was exploring the idea of visualizing multi-host Docker networking.

  * Spreading and collating containers on [GlusterFS](http://gluster.org/) with [runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) -Mohamed Ashiq Liyazudeen, Hari Gowtham

By looking at runC demo in the kick-off video, we thought it would be good if we can run containers on GlusterFS and use it move containers around by saving and restoring the containers on shared volume.
  
I did not work on specific idea but I was helping teams and other attendees with their questions. I also worked on my upcoming tutorial [at Linux Con, Europe](http://sched.co/3xU5) on Data and Networking management with containers.
  
May be because of long weekend and other events we got less participation. Hopefully we do better next time.
