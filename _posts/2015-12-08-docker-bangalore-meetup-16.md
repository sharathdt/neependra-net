Last Saturday on 5th Dec&#8217;15 we had another Docker meetup at Dell&#8217;s India R & D office in Bangalore. I think this was most attended meetup and very well organized. We had great set of talks lined up this time.
  
Docker 1.9 &#8211; New Features &#8211;Â [Sreenivas Makam](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sreenivasmakam), Cisco
  
Practical Docker Solution &#8211; [Kesav Kolla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkolla),Â CTO HotelSoft
  
Docker usage & benefit in Dell OpenManage products &#8211; Â [Prashant K S Â R](https://twitter.com/kosigiprasanth), Dell
  
Project Atomic and multi container packagingÂ Â &#8211; [Lalatendu Mohanthy](https://twitter.com/lalatenduM), Red Hat
  
We started with Q & A session and this time we could definitely see the shift in the quality of questions people asked. We hadÂ questions like choosing the right container orchestration tool, Â Docker is production etc. Â The first talk was from [Sreenivas Makam](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sreenivasmakam) who talked about latest feature of Docker 1.9.

    Overall it was a great meetup. As there were lots of questions around Container Orchestration, we thought of doing the Orchestration specific meetup next time.
