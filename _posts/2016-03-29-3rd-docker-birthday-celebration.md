Bangalore Docker Community celebrated [Docker&#8217;s 3rd Birthday on 26th March&#8217;16](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/228369734/) at Huawei&#8217;s Bangalore office. [Suraj](https://twitter.com/surajd_) has written a  [great report about the event](https://deshmukhsuraj.wordpress.com/2016/03/28/docker-birthday-3-celebration-bangalore/). So I would cover some other points.

  * More than 400 RSVPed for the event, so we had to divide the group i<a title="WP_20160326_09_22_17_Pro" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neependra/26060363136/in/dateposted-public/" data-flickr-embed="true"><img class="alignright" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1447/26060363136_db8c2a3687_m.jpg" alt="WP_20160326_09_22_17_Pro" width="99" height="177" /></a>n two batches and we were expecting ~100 in each. Due to long weekend we had ~70 people in first batch and ~35 in second batch. We could have easily accommodated everyone is one batch, if people have updated RSVPs accordingly. Please do not RSVP is you don&#8217;t plan to come.
  * Few of us discussed that in India we mostly have the user base and hardly have any committer to Docker.  To start contributing back to the project,  we decided to start doing beta testing for Docker releases.
  * <div id="past-event-description-wrap" class="line margin-bottom">
      Also we thought of doing small hackathon&#8217;s in which we&#8217;ll start going through Docker code base and learn from it.
