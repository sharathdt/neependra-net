[Mohit](https://twitter.com/mohitsethi) and I met atÂ Â [first GitHub meetup of Bangalore](http://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Github-Meetup/events/229454990/) in March&#8217;16 and discussed that it would be a good idea to do a jointÂ meetup of [Docker](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/) and [DevOps](http://www.meetup.com/devops-bangalore/)Â groups of Bangalore. Later we followed up and decided to do it on 30th April&#8217;16. It was hosted at IBM&#8217;s EGL office in Bangalore. We decided to do a full day event as we received a good number of topic suggestions.Â 250 people RSVPed for the meetup and ~100 people came for the meetup.

I started the meetup by going through theÂ [Docker and the Three Ways of DevOps white paper](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/WP_Docker%20and%20the%203%20ways%20devops_07.31.2015%20(1).pdf)Â to reiterate why Docker and DevOps goes hand in hand in recent times.
  
After that [Jeeva S.](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jeevachelladhurai) from IBM talked about doingÂ CI/CD using [GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker](http://files.meetup.com/11185112/CI-CD%20using%20GitHub%20Jenkins%20and%20Docker%20by%20Jeeva.pdf). After talking about Jenkins 2.0 features, he showed how he built a CI/CD pipeline using [Docker 3rd Birthday App and Jenkins](https://github.com/sjeeva/docker-birthday-3). Another gentleman from IBM then talked about how IBM uses Jenkins to do CI for the Power Platform.Â [Sudipto Biswas](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/sudipto-biswas/11/16/aa1) andÂ [Manjunath K](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manjunathkumatagi)Â  then shared their team&#8217;s experience of [runningÂ 10K containers on one physical machine.](http://goo.gl/6qykNW)
  
NextÂ session was from [Burr Sutter](https://twitter.com/burrsutter) of Red Hat, who gave an excellent [presentations on Mircoservices and DevOps.](http://bit.ly/helloworldmsa) He compared Docker and Microservices toÂ magic, which we think isÂ going to solve all the world&#8217;s problems. Is it ? Â Docker and Microservices are really hot these days but in some time this is going to stabilize and we&#8217;ll move to some-thing new.

But that does not mean companies should not adopt them. In the near futureÂ they would become normal and we don&#8217;t think of them as a universal solver of the world&#8217;s problems ðŸ™‚ . He also shared a blueprint of the journey which everyÂ company has to go through to adopt DevOps and Microservices.
  
After thatÂ [Pradeep Chhetri](https://twitter.com/p_chhetri) gave a good introductionÂ of [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) and how we can use it for doing CI/CD using Jenkins framework.
  
Post lunch we hadÂ [Abhishek Narain](https://twitter.com/narainabhishek) from Microsoft, who talked about [Azure container service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/container-service/) and how we can use Mesos or Docker Swarm as a container orchestration engine on the Azure Platform.
  
After thatÂ [Harendra Singh](https://twitter.com/chetan_tarale) and [Chetan Tarale](https://twitter.com/chetan_tarale) from Shippable gave a presentation on [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com/) platform with a demo.
  
Last presentation of the day was from [Balaji](https://twitter.com/baljanak) of [Calm.io](http://calm.io/), who talked about doing CI/CD with Jenkins &Â Calm.io. He did not pitch about their platform and focused mostly on how to do CI/CD and the need of DevOps, which is a really good thing to do in such community events.
  
Next Bangalore [Docker Meetup is scheduled on 4th June&#8217;16 and we&#8217;ll keep that Developer centric this time.](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/230868811/)
