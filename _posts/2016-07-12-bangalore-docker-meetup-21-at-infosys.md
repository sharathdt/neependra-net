We had our last Docker Meetup at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) on 9th July&#8217;16. Though some 300 RSVPed but only 80 people attended. It is good to see company like Infosys coming forward and hosting such meetup. Thanks to [Ganesh](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ganeshsubramanian73) from Infosys for taking the lead here and making it happen.

After that I talked about my [DockerCon](http://2016.dockercon.com) experience and briefed everyone about announcements made at DockerCon&#8217;16 like Docker 1.12, new Swarm mode, AWS and Azure beta, Window and Mac Beta etc.
  
[Ajeet](https://twitter.com/ajeetsraina) then talked about Docker 1.12 release, Docker Swarm. He talked about scaling, routing mesh, constraints etc. He then gave demo of Docker Swarm with Docker 1.12.

Continuing on the network topic, [Suraj](https://twitter.com/surajd_) talked about _macvlan_ and _ipvlan_ and gave excellent demos for both of them. With _macvlan_ and _ipvlan, _container can get IP address from the local LAN.
  

  
We then moved to Docker security and as usual [Srinivas Makam](https://twitter.com/srmakam) gave excellent session of Docker Security. I always learn something from him. He talked about namespaces, cgroups, capabilities, seccomp, SELinux, image scanning , Docker Engine secure access, best practices etc.

Infosys team has recoded the sessions and hopefully they would share it in public domain soon.  During the meetup we also announced about the [Docker 1.12 hackathon ](https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/docker-1-12-hackathon/) and we are planning to hands-on with people who registered for hackathon on 16th July.
  
We would be doing the next Docker meetup some time in August 3rd week.
