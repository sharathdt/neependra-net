Docker organised [Global Mentor Week around the world between 14-19th Nov&#8217;16](https://blog.docker.com/2016/10/docker-global-mentor-week-2016/). In [Bangalore we scheduled it on 19th Nov at Microsoft office](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/234873137/). We divided the group into two groups Beginner and Intermediate of 125 each. Out of which ~60 turned up for each session.
  
The [content for the mentor week](http://training.docker.com/category/docker-mentor-week) was shared by the Docker, which had hands-on exercises for basic and intermediate level.  Microsoft provided [Azure pass](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) for every participant so that we all can have same working environment. But during the workshop we faced some internet issue, so everyone could not hands-on on that day.  But with Azure pass and labs, participants can try out the hands-on later.
  
For the beginner level we had four mentors [Sreenivas Makam](https://twitter.com/srmakam), [Bathrinath Raveendran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bathri), [Ratheesh T M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rathneesh-m-7b803a13)  and [myself](https://twitter.com/neependra). Sreenivas did the heavy lifting by walking through the [Docker basics and labs](http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/docker-birthday-3-intro-to-docker-slides). He also shared the [notes to try out Docker Mentor Week&#8217;s lab on Azure](http://www.slideshare.net/SreenivasMakam/docker-mentorweek-beginner-workshop-notes). We had the beginner session between ~9:40 AM to 12:145 PM.

After the lunch we did the intermediate training. As the internet was not working, we decided to share the concept of [Container Orchestration in general](https://cloudyuga.gitbooks.io/container-orchestration/content/orchestration.html) and then with [Docker Swarm we showcased a sample application](https://cloudyuga.gitbooks.io/container-orchestration/content/swarm.html). I used the [content from my LinuxCon/ContainerCon workshop](http://neependra.net/?p=1861) which I did last month in Berlin.

After that [Ajeet](https://twitter.com/ajeetsraina/) showed how to prepare Docker Swarm cluster on Azure and [run & scale the sample application](https://cloudyuga.gitbooks.io/container-orchestration/content/swarm.html).

Both sessions were very interactive. I hope more people would have joined from the confirmed list. I had to say no to few group members as they could not get the confirmed ticket.
