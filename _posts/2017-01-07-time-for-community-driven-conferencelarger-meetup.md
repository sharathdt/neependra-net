You name the technology and you would find active meetup in Bangalore. Be it [Docker](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/), [DevOps](https://www.meetup.com/devops-bangalore/), [AWS](https://www.meetup.com/awsugblr/), [GlusterFS](https://www.meetup.com/glusterfs-India/), Machine Learning etc. Every meetup  group meets at-least once in every two months and share the knowledge. These days cloud, be it public or private seems to common platform for everyone and containers are slowly becoming unit of execution.  There are few conferences which are dedicated on these topics which bring people together. This idea is on similar lines but the quest is whether can we do a conference which driven by the community ?
  
Last year [Docker and DevOps](http://neependra.net/?p=1762) meetup group did a joint one day meetup, for which we received good feedback. By doing such a joint meetup we can extend it to mini-conference but there are few questions which arise :-

  * Who would provide the venue ?
  * What if we announce the conference, sell few tickets but don&#8217;t have enough fund to pull it off ?
  * What if we don&#8217;t find the sponsors ?
  * etc..

Can we play safe here ? May be Yes !!! With discussion with some of the other meetup organiser we thought of following:-
  
&nbsp;
  
[<img class="wp-image-2125 size-large aligncenter" src="http://neependra.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Containers-and-DevOps-community-event-4-720x1024.png" alt="containers-and-devops-community-event-4" width="450" height="640" />](http://neependra.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Containers-and-DevOps-community-event-4.png)
  
We&#8217;ll open-up 200 registration in the beginning and then ask people to pay 200 per ticket. 200 registrations because that is what we can accommodate in a meetup, if event does not happen. We are charging some money to make sure participant is really interested.
  
Once 200 people are signed up we can go to companies for sponsoring the venue. The company can pay us or directly to the venue/event management. If we don&#8217;t get the sponsorship  then we&#8217;ll just to a meetup  as usual. Whatever money we collected so far, we can give that back in prizes during the meetup.
  
Sounds good ?? This is just a concept now. Lets see if we can take it forward in next week or so. Do leave your comments if you suggestions/idea ?
