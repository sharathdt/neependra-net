Continuing our [experiment with community driven conference](http://neependra.net/?p=2124), this time [AWS,DevOps and Docker meetup collaborated to do a combined meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/237128791/). We charged INR 100 to each participants to make sure they are really interested in coming.Â From the collected money [we gave gifts to speakers and some prized to the participants](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xT06I0pLyzglfwpScaWr1FMR5G4pD-K271p0ify9YDE/edit#gid=0). The meetup was hosted at Bangalore&#8217;s LinkedIn office. It was really nice venue and and everything went as expected.

AWS, DevOps and Docker Meetup &#8211; Feb&#8217;17
  
Out of 150 participants ~140 showed up, which is really nice. Some people came from Chennai and Cochin as well. So putting a nominal fee really works :).Â We started almost on time. The first talk was from [Neeraj Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neerajx86/) from Minjar Cloud. He shared his experience on [how he deployed application on ECS](https://www.slideshare.net/neerajx86/leveraging-amzon-ec2-container-services-for-container-orchestration). He mentioned the advantages of using ECS to deploy Docker based application on Cloud and why one should use it.

[Sreenivas Makam](https://twitter.com/srmakam) then [talked about Docker 1.13 experimental feature](https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2017/01/27/docker-1-13-experimental-features/)s. HeÂ briefly introduced us with new features of Docker 1.13 and then focussed on experimental feature. Experimental features can enabled from stable binary only, which is a real help for anyone who wants to try out upcomingÂ Docker features. In the end we also good discussion about Docker Stack.

We took a quick break after that and had quick intro session with all the organisers. After the break [Madan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madanganeshv/) shared some great [tips on saving cost with AWS.](https://www.slideshare.net/actonmagic/aws-cost-optimisation-made-easy)

After that [Shamasis](https://twitter.com/shamasis)Â shared [Postman&#8217;s scaling journey with Docker and AWS Beanstalk](https://www.slideshare.net/shamasis/the-scaling-story-of-postman). It was really fascinating.

In the first Flash talk [Gourav Shah](https://twitter.com/gouravshah) open-sourced Â a project on creatingÂ Devops workspaces using Docker. Generally one is required to have more than one machined to try DevOps tools like Chef, Puppet Ansible etc. With this tool one can build a multi-node setup using Docker and do different labs.
  
The last session was from [Mitesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitesh-sharma-76722015/), who showed to use [Jenkins and CodeDeploy to deploy the applications on AWS.](http://www.slideshare.net/mitesh_sharma/build-and-deployment-with-jenkins-and-code-deploy-on-aws)

All of the sessions were very informative, venue was host, participants were eager to learn.Â I think it was really good meetup.
  
Thanks to all the speakers and our host [Bathri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bathri/) and [Sethil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/senthilkumar-eswaran-758a961/)Â at LinkedIn. Thanks to organisers for AWS and DevOps meetup group specially [Mohit](https://twitter.com/mohitsethi) and [Habeeb](https://twitter.com/habi_pk).
  
During the meetup some other meetup groups came forward to join us next time. We might do something around Micro-services and Serverless in April last week in the similar mode. So stay tuned ðŸ™‚
