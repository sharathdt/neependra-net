Last weekend  we had [4th Kubernetes Meetup in Bangalore](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Kubernetes-Meetup/events/237424647/) at VMware&#8217;s office. More than 100 people signed and ~40 people showed  up. The first session was from  [Akshay Mathur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathurakshay/) and [Manu Dilip Shah ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manu-dilip-shah-a74388b/) of [A10 Networks](https://www.a10networks.com) who shared their experience on [choosing  and using Kubernetes for their  product](https://www.slideshare.net/AkshayMathur7/kubernetes-as-orchestrator-for-a10-lightning-controller).

Some participants asked about comparing Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos Marathon and other container orchestration. We had brief  discussion about I share my l[ast year&#8217;s LinuxCon/ContainerCon EU workshop](http://neependra.net/?p=1861) on [comparing different  container orchestrators](https://cloudyuga.gitbooks.io/container-orchestration/).
  
We also talked about on what we should do in in the next Kubernetes meetup. We might do hands-on labs.
  
In the end I also shared the details about the [community event we are doing in conjunction with other meetup groups](http://neependra.net/?p=2124) like one we did few weeks back [AWS, DevOps and Docker meetup groups. ](http://neependra.net/?p=2158)  In April we plan to do similar event  on Microservices and Serverless. Other than previous participants [Kubernetes](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Kubernetes-Meetup/) and [Mesos & CNCF meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Mesos-cncf-User-Group/) would also be joining it.
  
It was a good meetup. Thanks for the organisers and speakers.
