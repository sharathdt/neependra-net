In Bangalore we celebrated [Docker&#8217;s 4th Birthday at Microsoft Office on 25th March&#8217;17.](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Bangalore/events/237842959/) Over 300 participants signed up and around 100 turned up for the event. We had around 15 mentors. We started the event at 9:30 AM. After a quick round  to introduction with Mentors,  participants started doing the [Docker Birthday Labs.](http://training.play-with-docker.com)  Docker community and team have done a great job in creating self explanatory labs with _Play with Docker_ environment.

Most of the participants followed the instructions on their own and where ever needed, mentors helped the participants. Around 11:30 AM our host Sudhir gave a quick demo [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/container-service/) and then we did the cake cutting. This time only one girl attended the meetup event, so we requested her to cut the cake.

After that we had light snacks and spent time in networking. It was great event and I am sure participants would have learnt something new.
