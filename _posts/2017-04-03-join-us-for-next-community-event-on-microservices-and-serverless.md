Instead of INR 200 we charged INR 100 and did not look for sponsors. [With all the collected money we gave gifts and prizes to speakers and participants respectively](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xT06I0pLyzglfwpScaWr1FMR5G4pD-K271p0ify9YDE/edit#gid=0). We received very good feedback about the event. In that event we decided to next event around Microservices and Serverless. This time even more meetup groups are coming together. Following 8 meetup groups would be joining hands this time :-
